# [/r/CompetitiveOverwatch](https://reddit.com/r/competitiveoverwatch) CSS & Images

### Building
* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `npm run build` to minify images and CSS
    - Alternatively, `npm run build-css`/`npm run build-img` individually
* Find minified CSS in `dist/final.css` and compressed images in `dist/images`

### Structure
* CSS: `src/main.css`
* Raw image files (PSDs): `src/images-psd`
* Exported image files (JPG/PNG): `src/images-export`

### Notes
* The CSS was originally based on [Naut](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit), which has since been mostly merged in to free up file space (based on Reddit's CSS size limit of 100 KB)

### 3rd Party Image Sources
* Main spritesheet – [Naut](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit/blob/master/PSD/spritesheet.psd) with heavy customisations
* Flag spritesheet assembled from [FlagKit flag images](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/tree/master/Images)
* Sidebar:
    - [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/p/brand-assets)
    - [Twitter](https://brand.twitter.com/en.html)
